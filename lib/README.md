*combine_weather_data*: Aggregates the thousands of raw csv files into one large weather data table to be inserted in the database. Raw data not stored in Github repo because of limited storage capacity.

*weather_data_transform*: Averages the temperature and precipation readings from all stations within a given country, and inserts that table into the weather.sqlite database.
