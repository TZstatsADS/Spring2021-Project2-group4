### Output folder

The output directory contains analysis output, processed datasets, logs, or other processed things.

Contains the weather data aggregated from thousands of weather stations. Tables in the SQLite database include **weather** which includes all of the aggregated weather data. **weather_transformed** includes the averages of max, min, average temperature, and precipitation for for each country, as well as the station count for that country. **weather_transformed_grouped** is the same as **weather_transformed** but the weather data is averaged across all of the US states. The csv file is the same as the **weather** table but as a csv file. The thousands of station csv files that were aggregated together are not included in the repository for storage reasons.
