### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

The data is in input_data folder.

hosp-by-day.csv is from the 2019 NYC coronavirus trends data, holding data about daily hospitalizations in nyc in different parts of the city and citywide, with 7-day averaged counts.

coronavirus_states.csv has covid data (cases, deaths, more) given dates for various states in the US.
