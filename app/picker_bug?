Here is the part in the ui (the original dataframe is called " wc1" here.) :

uitabs3 <- shinyUI( navbarPage("Weather and Covid", id="nav", theme="bootstrap.css",

                               tabPanel("Multivar. Time Series Country",
                                        pickerInput("country_select", "Choose Country:",
                                                    choices=as.character(unique(wc1$country)),
                                                    options = list(`actions-box` = TRUE, `none-selected-text` = "Please make a selection!"),
                                                    selected = as.character(wc1$country)[1])
                               )
))


Here is the part in the server:

servertabs3 <- function(input, output) {
 
 
  c_reactive_db = reactive({
    wc1 %>% filter(wc1$country %in% input$country_select)
  })

# do time series with c_reactive_db


}
